This was a frontend coding challenge from https://www.frontendmentor.io/

I got the design and assets from this URL https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ.

And I built the profile card component using Next JS and React.

And, I also used the Tailwind CSS library to style the component.
